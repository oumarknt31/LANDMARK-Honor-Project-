# INSPIRATION BEHIND LANDMARK

The absence of user-friendly STEM apps has been a source of frustration for me, which ultimately inspired the creation of 'Landmark'. Another reason behind the creation of 'Landmark' is the limitations of traditional STEM learning methods. I recognized that these methods often lack personalization, engagement, and a focus on real-world application. This can lead to students feeling bored, unmotivated, and unprepared for STEM careers. 

This personalized platform provides STEM students, and anyone willing to learn, with engaging content, interactive quizzes, and a focus on cultivating the problem-solving and computational thinking abilities crucial for success in today's technology-driven world.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Landmark is a powerful app created to help users learn and excel in STEM subjects. It offers interactive learning materials and engaging quizzes for students looking to strengthen their foundation in computer science or mathematics. Whether you're a student or a lifelong learner, Landmark is the perfect platform to enhance your understanding and test your progress in the vast world of STEM.

Key Features:

Learn: Explore the learning materials, such as text and websites made for your chosen STEM subject.

Quiz: Test your comprehension and reinforce your understanding with interactive quizzes featuring various question formats. These quizzes are designed to evaluate your knowledge and showcase areas for improvement.

# CHALLENGES
My biggest challenge was mastering Qt and its features from scratch. Also, converting existing C++ code into a Qt-compatible format was a complex task. However, by overcoming these obstacles, I gained valuable experience and developed a comprehensive and engaging platform.

In addition to tackling the complexities of learning Qt and converting C++ code, I encountered the challenge of selecting the most suitable algorithm to power the app's core functionality. Deciding on the optimal approach to personalize learning experiences, adjust quiz difficulty. Picking the right algorithm was tough, but it turned out to be quite rewarding. I had to think hard, compare different options, and weigh their pros and cons. In the end, I learned a lot of things that led to a successful implementation for my project.

The last challenge I encontered was facing inevitable bugs and errors in my code.

# ACCOMPLISHMENT

Learning the Qt Framework: I successfully learned and implemented the Qt framework, a useful tool for developing GUI application.

Developing a Well-Functioning Application: I built a fully functional application with intuitive features like learning materials and interactive quizzes. For me that's a very good way to start.

Expanded Knowledge: I gained valuable knowledge about STEM subjects, including computer science and mathematics, through the research and development process.

Developed Problem-Solving Skills: I was able to identified and solve technical challenges, which may demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems.

Perseverance and Resilience: I persevered through challenges and setbacks, because it was very difficult at the beginning of my project especially the way Qt framework works. Therefore, I develop my determination and ability to overcome obstacles.

# FUTURE DIRECTION
In the future, I would like to add more STEM subjects to Landmark, encouraging active participation with fun and collaborative features. It will connect learning to real-life applications. And I hope one day, my application will be implemented to benefits STEM major students and anyone willing to learn.
